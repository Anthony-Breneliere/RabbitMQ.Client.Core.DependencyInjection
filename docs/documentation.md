# Documentation

These files cover all functionality of the library and if the new feature comes out documentation will have details of that.
Documentation consists of four sections. **RabbitMQ configuration section** covers ways of configuring the connection to the RabbitMQ host or multiple hosts (HA cluster).
**Exchange configuration section** explains the difference between consumption and production exchanges in terms of this library as well as specific nuances of configuring them.
**Message production section** says about features of sending messages and **message consuming section** covers ways of receiving and handling messages.
